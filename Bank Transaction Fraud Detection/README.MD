**Fraud Detection Model **

### Problem Statement
This project focuses on developing a fraud detection model using historical transaction data. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, making it a binary classification problem.

### Data Imbalance
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with approximately 97.14% of transactions labeled as non-fraudulent and 2.86% labeled as fraudulent.

### Top Performing Algorithm
XGBoost Classifier emerged as the top-performing algorithm, providing high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on both training and test sets.

### Business Insights
- Temporal Patterns: Transaction month is crucial for detecting fraudulent activity.
- Behavioral Characteristics: Features like 'IsOldDevice' and 'webSessWebBrowser' offer insights into fraudster behavior.
- Transaction Details: Attributes such as 'V6CF' and 'V3CF' play a critical role in fraud prediction.

### Model Generalization
The model demonstrates consistent performance on out-of-sample testing, indicating its ability to generalize well to unseen data.
