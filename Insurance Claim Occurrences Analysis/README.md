**Project Title: Insurance Claim Occurrences Analysis**

**Overview:**
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing insurance claim occurrences in the context of car insurance policies. By identifying key features and patterns within the dataset, insurance companies can implement targeted risk mitigation strategies, enhance pricing models, and optimize operations to reduce claim losses.

**Key Features:**
1. **Policy Tenure:** The duration of the policyholder's relationship with the insurer may influence claim frequency.
2. **Age of Car:** The age of the insured vehicle is a significant factor affecting the likelihood of claims.
3. **Age of Policyholder:** Policyholders at different stages of life may demonstrate varying patterns in claim behavior.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered relevant data on insurance policies, including policy tenure, car age, policyholder age, and claim occurrences.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and outliers among the features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Processed and transformed features to prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Model Selection:** Evaluated various classification algorithms, with XG Boost emerging as the most promising model due to its strong performance across multiple metrics.
5. **Model Training:** Trained the XG Boost model using the dataset, optimizing parameters for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the performance of the model on both the training and test sets to ensure its effectiveness.
7. **Insights Generation:** Derived insights from the model results to understand the impact of different factors on claim occurrences.

**Business Conclusion:**
The analysis highlights the following key insights for insurance companies:
- **Policy Tenure:** Longer policy tenure may correlate with lower claim frequency, indicating higher customer loyalty and lower risk.
- **Age of Car:** Older vehicles are more likely to have claims, suggesting the importance of adjusting premiums based on car age to reflect potential risks accurately.
- **Age of Policyholder:** Different age groups may exhibit distinct claim behaviors, necessitating personalized risk management strategies and tailored insurance products.
